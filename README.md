# Python Challenge
## Background

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, I'll be using concepts learned to complete two 
Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. This small project has real world implications when it comes showcasing newly developed Python skills.

## PyBank

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company. I used my financial dataset called [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/faceadversity/python-challenge/files/12115879/budget_data.csv) as a form of reference. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".  

I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the financial records of my company to obtain the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

A final script was made to print within the terminal and export a text file that produced this resulting output [financial_analysis.txt](https://github.com/faceadversity/python-challenge/files/12115918/financial_analysis.txt).

## PyPoll

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was provided with a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/faceadversity/python-challenge/files/12115953/election_data.csv)
. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
