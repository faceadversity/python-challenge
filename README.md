# Python Challenge
## Background

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and enter the world of programming with Python. In this assignment, I'll be using concepts learned to complete two 
Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. This small project has real world implications when it comes showcasing newly developed Python skills.

## PyBank

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company. I used my financial dataset called budget_data.csv[budget_data.csv](https://github.com/faceadversity/python-challenge/files/12115879/budget_data.csv) as a form of reference. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".  

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your analysis should align with the following results:
